## About the Game

The game is based on the Pelmanism principle, after Christopher Louis Pelman, a British psychologist of the first half of the 20th century, where a player needs to flip over two hidden cards at a time, with the goal of turning over a matching pair, by using his/her memory.

The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly on the grid with the picture face down. Put your memory to the test with these quick-play games!

Match pairs: FRUITS
Match Pairs: GLOBAL LANDMARKS
Match Pairs: SPORTS

## Gameplay Rules

The gameplay rules are very simple: Click on any preferred card to start the game. Each turn, flip one card over to reveal its underlying picture. Then turn over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same picture.

If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Scores

The game has three score categories;

1. Time: Match all the cards in the shortest time possible.
2. Number of clicks/moves: Challenge yourself to match all the cards in as few moves as you can.
3. 3-star rating: Be sure to challenge yourself with a higher star if it's too easy!
1-star will display when number of moves is higher than 30.
2-star will display when number of moves is higher than 20 and lower than 30.
3-star will display when number of moves is lower than or equal to 20.

You will see your score at the end of the game. Have fun playing!
